# Code

In order to work on, compile this code, the STM32CubeIDE V 1.21.1 was used.
Therefore it is recommended to use this tool. 

#Disclaimer
I am not a Professional Software developer, nor am I paid to produce this software.
I know in many places I could write this code better, but my focus was on safe and reliable operation and not the code readability.
I developed this code in what little free time I had and tried to document it as well as possible. 
As such if you wish to improve the code, feel free.
